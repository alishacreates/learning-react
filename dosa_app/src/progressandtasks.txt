learned and typed code myself:

7th january: 
    1. useState
    2. Component
    3. Props
    4. Event: onClick

step 1:
Set up a React project (Vite recommended, port 5173).
Command: npm create vite@latest pizza-app → React → JavaScript
cd pizza-app → npm install → npm run dev
Create a Pizza component
Takes name and price as props
Renders a <div> showing name and price
Update App.jsx
Render at least 3 different Pizza components with different names/prices
Add simple styling
Either inline styles or a CSS file to make it look slightly nice

step2: 
You must implement ALL of this yourself:
1️⃣ In Pizza.jsx
Add a quantity state
Default value = 1
2️⃣ Add two buttons:
➕ Increase
➖ Decrease
3️⃣ Button behavior:
➕ increases quantity
➖ decreases quantity
Quantity should never go below 1
4️⃣ Display:
Show current quantity
Show total price
total = price * quantity

step 3:
You must implement ALL of this yourself:
1️⃣ Disable buttons (NO alerts anymore)
Disable ➕ when quantity === 10
Disable ➖ when quantity === 1
2️⃣ Show messages conditionally
If quantity === 10 → show:
“Maximum limit reached”
If quantity === 1 → show:
“Minimum quantity is 1”
